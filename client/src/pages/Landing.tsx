            <h3>What Are Auroras?</h3>
            <p>
                Auroras also know as the Northern or Southern Lights are often described as ribons of mostly green light that can be observed by people near the poles.
            </p>
            <h3>How Are Auroras Made</h3>
            <p>
                Auroras form when 4 things happen:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Solar Activity such as solar flares send charged particles towards Earth.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Earth's magnetic field acts as a barrier to most of these particles but the rest move towards the poles.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The particles collide with gasses in the upper atmosphere causing light to be emitted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The different gasses in the atmosphere produce different colors. The most common color is green and is made by Monatomic Oxygen
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <h3>Where Can I See an Aurora</h3>
            <p>Auroras are most common and intense near the poles but can be seen as 40° or -40° latitude from the poles</p>
